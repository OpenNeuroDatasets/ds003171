17 healthy adults scanned on a 3T Siemens scanner. Participants completed auditory task (passive listening to a clip from the movie "Taken") and rest conditions at 4 levels of sedation: Awake, Light, Deep, Recovery.

Stimulus during task conditions was continuous. The audio clip was begun 10 seconds into the scan, however the five dummy volumes (TR=2s) at the beginning have already been removed, so the stimulus onset in the nifti file lines up with the first volume.
